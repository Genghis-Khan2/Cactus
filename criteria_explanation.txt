Since we can't add comments about the specification of the layout of th json file, we'll do it here

We will have 2 objects: packet filter and a proxy, each with multiple fields containing information
about that object

* packet filter:
    Contains criteria for the packet filter
    * whitelisting - Is the code whitelisting, so only preapproved hosts will be able to access, 
                     or will it be blacklisted so anyone who isn't disapproved can access
    * blacklist
        blacklisted_macs - Macs to be dropped
        blacklisted_ips - IPs to be dropped (Source obviously. This is configured to be)
        blacklisted_ports - Ports to be dropped (Destination ports obviously. Source ports don't matter)
        blacklisted_specific_ip_port_sets - Ordered pairs of (ip, port) to be blacklisted
                                            The reason we need this and ip and port separately is if we want access
